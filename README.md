# COVID-19 Awareness Website (Archive)

This repository contains the source code for a website I built (circa 2020-2021) for a web design competition. The theme was "Fight Against Corona," and the goal was to create an informational hub to spread awareness and share resources about the pandemic.

The entire site was built from scratch, serving as an early, in-depth exercise in front-end development.

## Repository Status

**Please Note:** This is a public archive and is **not actively maintained**. The code is preserved here for historical and personal reference and **does not reflect my current skill level.**

This was an early project, and the code is provided as-is. The design and structure were part of a learning process and may not represent current web development best practices.

## Project Overview

This website was designed to be a simple, multi-page resource. It provided visitors with key information on preventative measures and offered resources for both physical and mental well-being during the pandemic.

### Core Features

* **Informational Sections:** The homepage features animated cards on four key topics:
    * Washing Hands
    * Wearing a Mask
    * Social Distancing
    * Getting Vaccinated
* **"Knowledge" Page:** A section with more detailed information and links to official resources (like the W.H.O.).
* **"Mind & Body" Page:** A section focused on mental health, emotional intelligence, and resilience during lockdown.
* **"Flip" Page:** A unique section dedicated to finding the "positive side" of the situation, such as the rise of new technology and a greater sense of gratitude.

### Technologies Used

This project was intentionally **hand-coded** from the ground up to practice fundamental web skills.

* **HTML5:** Used for the structure of all pages.
* **CSS3:** Used for all styling, layout, and animations (such as the text animations, card hover effects, and animated buttons). No CSS frameworks (like Bootstrap) were used in the main styling, though Bootstrap was included for some components.
